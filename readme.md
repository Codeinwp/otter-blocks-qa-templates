# Otter Tool Testing
> This tool insert blocks exports into the page.

## Getting started

Use together with [Query Engine](https://github.com/Soare-Robert-Daniel/otter-query-engine)

You can use the chrome browser extension to add the script in every page. You can add the folder `chrome-extension` via [Developer Mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension,%20and%20more.)

## Concepts

Every folder represent a source/database from which we can get the exported blocks. Every folder that is used a source/database must have `index.json` in which we list the available files and their features. See `blocks/index.json` as example.
